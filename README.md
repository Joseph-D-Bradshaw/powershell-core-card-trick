# Powershell Core Magic Trick
21 card magic trick done in PowerShell Core, done on my first day of PowerShell as a test to get used to the syntax.

To use:
- Simply take the cards.ps1 file and place it anywhere on your system
- Ensure you use Set-ExecutionPolicy to a policy that will allow you to run scripts
- Open up PowerShell, navigate to this file and run it via .\cards.ps1
- Finally, pick a card from the options shown and tell the program which row your card is in.
- Repeat for the magic!
